#+STARTUP: indent
* Performance
** TODO Stop passint device around during initialization
** TODO implement next state as a tensor op


- DONE stop passing device around during initiation
Use a context manager instead
- TODO run profiler on a training session
training is still slow on the gpu. why is this?

*** DONE implement available moves as a tensor operation

*** DONE implement next state as a tensor operation

* TODO Beat Jenny [1/3]
Here are the tasks to do
- [X] implement baine encoding [1/1]
  - [X] implement barrier count
- [ ] implement EPC
- [ ] run with 160 hidden

** TODO Implement Baine Encoding
This should working
- use squeeze and unsqueeze to do matrix multiplication instead of my for loop

*** TODO Implement barrier count
*** TODO Implement EPC
*** TODO Run with 160 hidden

* Logic
** TODO implement move computation one move per step instead of a huge pass over all moves

** TODO Stop passing player_1 around separately from board
put player_1 as part of the board, so it's [0, ..... {1, -1}]


**

* Feedback Loop
** TODO keep track of parameters
When I write a model to a directory, I need to store certain
metadata so tha tit can be loaded properly
  - how many hidden paramters
  - how many out parameters (4 or 6)?
  - maybe alpha and lambda


** TODO add simple charting script
make it simple to chart a learning model's progress

** DONE dockerize evaluation


** DONE backgammon correctness
confirm that game logic works correctly. THIS IS DONE IN src/test_game_play.py

** TODO Factor backgammon logic into
There should be 3 classes
- randomly allocate initial_state
- compute all possible moves (and their corresponding next states?)
- tesauro encode them; should be the same across all states, and correct


* Squeezing More out of TD
** Plies
*** TODO implement 3-ply look-ahead
*** TODO implement selective 2-ply look-ahead;
*** TODO do some experimentation: how often does 2-ply change vs 1-ply?
** Parameters

*** perform a grand experiment to vary lambda, alpha, and number of hidden layers

*** dynamically update learning rate

*** learning rate schedule


* Encoding
** TODO Effective Pip Count
** TODO unary encoding of length of barricade at each point

* Neural Networks
** TODO try different levels of hidden layers
** TODO does 6 vs 4 outputs matter?

* Documentation

on README, show how to build and run docker
