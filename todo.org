* Performance

** DONE stop passing device around during initiation
Use a context manager instead

** TODO run profiler on a training session
training is still slow on the gpu. why is this?

** DONE implement available moves as a tensor operation

** DONE implement next state as a tensor operation


* Logic

** TODO keep track of parameters
When I write a model to a directory, I need to store certain
metadata so tha tit can be loaded properly
  - how many hidden paramters
  - how many out parameters (4 or 6)?
  - maybe alpha and lambda


** TODO Stop passing player_1 around separately from board
put player_1 as part of the board, so it's [0, ..... {1, -1}]


**

* Feedback Loop

** TODO add simple charting script
make it simple to chart a learning model's progress

** DONE dockerize evaluation


** DONE backgammon correctness
confirm that game logic works correctly. THIS IS DONE IN src/test_game_play.py

** TODO Factor backgammon logic into
There should be 3 classes
- randomly allocate initial_state
- compute all possible moves (and their corresponding next states?)
- tesauro encode them; should be the same across all states, and correct


* Squeezing More out of TD
** Plies
*** TODO implement 3-ply look-ahead
*** TODO implement selective 2-ply look-ahead;
*** TODO do some experimentation: how often does 2-ply change vs 1-ply?
** Parameters

*** perform a grand experiment to vary lambda, alpha, and number of hidden layers

*** dynamically update learning rate

*** learning rate schedule


* Encoding
** TODO Effective Pip Count
** TODO unary encoding of length of barricade at each point

* Neural Networks
** TODO try different levels of hidden layers
** TODO does 6 vs 4 outputs matter?

* Documentation

on README, show how to build and run docker
